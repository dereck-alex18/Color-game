This project was created to train a person who wants to detects a color just looking at its RGB.

The game consists of 3 different levels (Easy, Hard and Insane), where each level will contain a
certain number of squares (3, 6 and 9 respectively) and also a different number of attempts. 
Each square will have a color, which is picked randomly, every time the game restart or when the
user clicks on "New Colors" button. 

On the top of the page, there is a header which displays the color to be guessed. If a wrong color is
clicked then its square fades out. When the player goes unsuccessful and can't guess the color, all squares will change to the correct color.
